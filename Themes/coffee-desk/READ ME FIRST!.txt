Hello,

There are many other color options available at the theme's page.
Version 2.0 has code changes made in response to suggestions made by other bloggers who are currently using this theme.

You may use this theme as long as you leave the original design credits on the footer.

Since I know this theme's code very well, and have the original image files,
it would only take me a second to help you out if you run into any problems. 

Feel free to Email me at: theme@roam2rome.com

Enjoy!
